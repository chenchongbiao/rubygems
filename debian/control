Description: Package management framework for Ruby
 A package (also known as a library) contains a set of functionality that can
 be invoked by a Ruby program, such as reading and parsing an XML file. These
 packages are called 'gems' and RubyGems is a tool to install, create, manage
 and load these packages in your Ruby environment. RubyGems is also a client for
 RubyGems.org, a public repository of Gems that allows you to publish a Gem that
 can be shared and used by other developers.
